## Installation

### Pipenv

The notebooks in this repo require Python 3.10 and Jupyer Lab. A virtual environment, such as [`pipenv`](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/), is reccommended. 

To get stated, clone the repo and navigate into it using the terminal. 

Next, run `pipenv shell` to create a virual environment. 

Then, run `pipenv install` to add the dependancies ([Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [Geopandas](https://geopandas.org/en/stable/), etc.) you'll need.

You should be ready to work. Run `jupyter lab` to launch the browser interface.

### Alternative approach

Clone repo and navigate into it using the terminal. Install a few requirements, if not already installed (assumes macOS and homebrew):

    $ brew install geos
    $ brew install freetype

Create and activate virtual environment:

    $ python3 -m venv env
    $ source env/bin/activate

Install Rust and its package manager, Cargo. Get the latest install instructions [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

Install Python packages:

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

You should be ready to work. Run `jupyter lab` to launch the browser interface.

When finished, run `deactivate` to "leave" the virtual environment.

You'll need to run `source env/bin/activate` each time, which is a bit more cumbersome than using pipenv.
